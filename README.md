# **CRONOS**
## This is an explenation about Cronos. 

Cronos is an extension that will works in some way similary to a Time Machine for Mac's. Â¿What is the difference then?.
Well, below I will describe some features.

* You just need your Visual Studio Code which works in Windows, Linux and Mac.
* All your files will be save into your project folder.
* You decide when to use It - It's recommanable to active the extension everytime you open Visual Studio Code -.
* You will be provide by a dashboard where you'll be able to surf through it and find old changes that had been made in your files.
* There is no need of configurations. Only install the extension, that's all.

## How to starting using Cronos.

Open a project folder where you're going to work and then press `F1` or `Fn + F1`. Then type *cronos* and then `Enter`.

>**Note**: You can type *cronos* using uppercase or lowercase.

>**Important**: The extension will works only if you open a folder and not if you open a single file to edit It.

If is the first time you're using the extension into a project, this will create (just one time) a list of folders with some files, after hitting `Enter`. Then will appears two a pop-ups; one showing
the names of the files and the other showing the local url where you can have access to the dashboard using your favorite browser.

Files that will be create
- cronostime
    - cronos.time.html
    - cronos.time.js
    - cronos.time.js
   
>**Warning** (Don't modify any of this files, because you could change the behavior of the extension).

If you want to look for older files that had been modifying by you, you can access to the dashbord. Just go to
`localhost:3000`. There you have, your dashboard.

Enjoy the extension and sends me please some feedback - goods or bads.
