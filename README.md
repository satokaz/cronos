# **CRONOS**
Cronos will help you to keep all the changes that you have made onto your files. This means, if you close your actual Visual Studio window project for any reason, you can always have access to your old files where you made changes, accessing to the dashboard panel.

## Some features
* You just need your Visual Studio Code which works in Windows, Linux and Mac.
* All your files will be save into your project folder.
* You decide when to use It - It's recommanable to active the extension everytime you open Visual Studio Code -.
* You will be provide by a dashboard where you'll be able to surf through it and find old changes that had been made in your files.
* There is no need of configurations. Only install the extension, that's all.

## How to starting using Cronos.

Open a project folder where you're going to work and then press `F1` or `Fn + F1`. Then type *cronos* and then `Enter`.

>**Note**: You can type *cronos* using uppercase or lowercase.

>**Warning**: The dashboard will be displayed just for one project opened. If you have two project open the dashboard will only show you the files of the second project opened. This is because the local server (First project) will be overwrite by the second one (Second project).

>**Important**: The extension will works only if you open a folder and not if you open a single file to edit It.

If this is the first time you're using the extension into a project, this will create (just one time) a list of folders with some files, after hitting `Enter`. Then will appears two a pop-ups; one showing
the names of the files and the other showing the local url where you can have access to the dashboard using your favorite browser.
